 * Without this, anything that ended up inside an `Error` message or stack — a pg error
 * carrying row values, a webhook URL containing a token, a request URL carrying a query-string
 * credential — was transmitted verbatim to the third party and retained there under its own
 * retention policy. The exception object is the one payload that the app's own logging layer
 * cannot intercept before it leaves the process, so it has to be scrubbed at the boundary.
 *
 * Applies the same key- and value-based policy as `src/common/logging/redaction.ts`, plus
 * dedicated passes for the `url` tag the exception filter attaches (path + query string), for
 * the HTTP `request` the SDK attaches to server-side errors, and for the breadcrumbs.
