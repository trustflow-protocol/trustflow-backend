/**
 * Decides whether this replica is the one that should broadcast an outbox event.
 *
 * #646: the outbox relays each event to a Redis pub/sub channel that *every* replica
 * subscribes to, and each replica then calls `server.to(room).emit()`. That is correct with
 * per-replica sockets but multiplies delivery once a Socket.IO adapter is in play, because an
 * adapter makes `server.to(...).emit()` cluster-wide — so with N replicas every client
 * receives N copies of the same milestone event.
 *
 * A per-process cache cannot fix that on its own, because each replica has its own. The
 * authoritative claim is therefore a Redis `SET NX EX`, which resolves the race across
 * replicas: the first replica to claim the event broadcasts it, the rest observe the existing
 * key and drop it. An in-process TTL cache sits in front as a fast path and as the sole source
 * of truth when Redis is unavailable.
 *
 * Degradation is deliberate: a Redis failure falls back to the local cache rather than
 * dropping the event. A duplicated notification is an annoyance; a silently dropped milestone
 * or deliverable event is a missed update, so a Redis outage must not suppress broadcasts.
