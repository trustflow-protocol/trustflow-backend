/**
 * Restricts access to addresses listed in `ADMIN_ADDRESSES` (comma-separated Stellar public
 * keys). Runs after `JwtAuthGuard`, which is what populates `request.user.address` — there is
 * no separate admin login flow, an admin authenticates with the same wallet-signature flow as
 * everyone else and is simply allow-listed by address.
 *
 * Deny-by-default: an unset or empty `ADMIN_ADDRESSES` locks every admin route out rather than
 * leaving them open, since there is no safe default allow-list for a protocol-admin surface.
