# Backup and Restore Runbook

How TrustFlow's state is backed up, how to restore it, and what the recovery objectives are.
Companion to [`transaction-boundaries.md`](./transaction-boundaries.md), which explains *why*
the stores are the way they are.

## What actually holds state

This is the part that is easy to get wrong, because it is not what the code suggests.

| Store | Driver | Contents | Consequence of loss |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Redis** | `ioredis` | Escrows, gigs, auth nonces, refresh tokens, rate-limit counters, idempotency keys, the outbox and its pending events | **Total loss of escrow and gig state.** The audit log is the only surviving record |
| **PostgreSQL** | `pg` | `audit_logs` only | Loss of the audit trail; escrow state itself is unaffected |

There is no ORM and no second copy of the aggregates in Postgres. Redis is the system of record
for anything a user would call "my data", so **a Redis backup is the critical one** — see
`docs/state-model.md` for how each aggregate is keyed.

## RPO / RTO

| Objective | Target | Achieved by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **RPO — Redis** | **≤ 15 minutes** | `BGSAVE` on a 15-minute schedule | With `appendfsync everysec` (see below), the on-disk AOF is at most ~1s behind, so the binding constraint is the backup interval, not Redis's own fsync |
| **RPO — Postgres** | **≤ 24 hours** | `pg_dump` nightly | Only the audit log; not on the critical path |
| **RTO — Redis** | **≤ 30 minutes** | Restore RDB/AOF into a fresh instance, point `REDIS_URL` at it, restart the app | Bounded by copy time, not by load: the RDB is loaded directly |
| **RTO — Postgres** | **≤ 60 minutes** | `pg_restore`/`psql` replay | A logical backup re-runs the load, so RTO grows with data size |

**These targets are not yet met by anything in this repository.** There is no restore that has
been performed on real data, no offsite copy, and no drill on a schedule. What exists here is
the mechanism plus an automated round-trip test. Treat the numbers above as the intended
contract, and close the gap in the "Known gaps" section before relying on them.

Why Redis is on the tighter schedule: it is the system of record. Why Postgres is not: losing
`audit_logs` costs the audit trail, not the escrow balances — and the balance is reconcilable
from the chain by `EscrowReconciliationService`.

## Why Redis persistence is not optional

Redis ships with persistence **off** by default in most managed configurations, and a stock
container has none. With `appendonly no`, a Redis restart silently discards every escrow and
gig, and the application comes back up perfectly healthy having lost all of it — the readiness
probe passes because the data really is gone, not because it is missing.

Minimum acceptable configuration (set in `docker-compose.yml` for local parity, and required
of the production deployment):

```
appendonly yes          # log every write; without this, restart = total loss
appendfsync everysec    # at most ~1s of acknowledged writes lost on power failure
dir /data               # a persistent volume, not the container's ephemeral layer
```

| `appendfsync` | Loss window on power failure | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `always` | ~0 | An fsync per write; large throughput cost |
| `everysec` | ~1 second | One fsync per second. **Recommended** |
| `no` | up to the OS's own flush interval | Not acceptable for money-adjacent state |

## Backup procedures

### Automated

`.github/workflows/scheduled-backups.yml` runs both scripts daily. It requires the
`BACKUP_DATABASE_URL` and `BACKUP_REDIS_URL` repository secrets; on a fork it skips rather than
fails.

### Manual — PostgreSQL

```bash
cd backend
DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:pass@host:5432/trustflow' \
  BACKUP_DIR=/var/backups/trustflow/postgres \
  BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=14 \
  bash scripts/backup-postgres.sh
```

Writes `trustflow-<UTC timestamp>.sql.gz` plus a `.sha256` and a `.meta` sidecar, then prunes
anything older than the retention window. It refuses to record an empty dump as a success, and
a non-zero `pg_dump` exit aborts before the retention step — otherwise a failed run would
eventually delete the last good backup.

### Manual — Redis

```bash
cd backend
REDIS_URL='redis://host:6379' \
BACKUP_DIR=/var/backups/trustflow/redis \
  bash scripts/backup-redis.sh
```

Issues `BGSAVE`, waits for it to finish, and copies `dump.rdb` (plus `appendonlydir` when a
local container is available) into a timestamped directory with a `manifest.sha256` and a
`meta` file recording the key count at snapshot time.

For a fully consistent point-in-time copy while Redis is serving writes, prefer
`redis-cli BGREWRITEAOF` or snapshotting a replica. `BGSAVE` is fork-consistent but captures
only what existed at the fork.

### Retention

14 days by default (`BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`). Only files matching this script's own prefix are
pruned, so pointing `BACKUP_DIR` at a shared directory will not delete unrelated content.

**Retention is not a backup strategy.** A backup held only on the machine that produced it has
not been tested against the failure it exists for. Copy snapshots off-host.

## Restore procedures

### PostgreSQL

```bash
cd backend

# 1. Always verify first — this writes nothing.
bash scripts/restore-postgres.sh --file <dump.sql.gz> --verify-only

# 2. Restore for real. --force is required if the target already has tables.
bash scripts/restore-postgres.sh --file <dump.sql.gz> --force
```

The script, in order:

1. Verifies the SHA-256 sidecar. Mismatch → exit `2`, nothing is written.
2. Runs `gzip -t` to catch truncation.
3. Confirms the dump actually contains SQL statements.
4. Refuses to touch a target that already has tables unless `--force` is passed — the dump
   uses `--clean --if-exists`, so it drops objects as it goes and a mistyped target is
   unrecoverable.
5. Restores with `ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --single-transaction`, so the first failing statement aborts
   the whole restore rather than leaving a half-loaded database reported as success.
6. Re-queries `information_schema` to confirm tables exist afterwards.

Exit codes: `1` usage/environment, `2` checksum or integrity failure (**do not trust the
dump**), `3` restore failed.

> **Client/server version skew.** A dump taken by a `pg_dump` newer than the target server can
> fail to restore, because newer clients emit GUCs older servers do not know — `pg_dump` 17+
> writes `SET transaction_timeout`, which does not exist before 17. The script strips that
> line and warns when it detects a skew, but the durable fix is to run `pg_dump` from a host
> whose major version matches the server.

### Redis

```bash
# 1. Recover the files from the snapshot directory.
SNAPSHOT=/var/backups/trustflow/redis/<timestamp>
(cd "$SNAPSHOT" && sha256sum -c manifest.sha256)

# 2a. RDB-only restore: stop the instance, replace the RDB, start it.
docker compose stop redis
cp "$SNAPSHOT/dump.rdb" ./redis-data/dump.rdb
docker compose start redis

# 2b. AOF restore: preserve the directory name and contents exactly.
docker compose stop redis
rm -rf ./redis-data/appendonlydir
cp -r "$SNAPSHOT/appendonlydir" ./redis-data/appendonlydir
docker compose start redis

# 3. Verify.
redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" DBSIZE      # compare against the snapshot's `meta` dbsize
redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" PING
```

Do **not** start the app against a restored Redis until `DBSIZE` is in the expected range. The
app boots successfully against an empty Redis, and starting it will mint new nonces and write
new escrows into the restored dataset.

### Post-restore checklist

1. `/health/ready` returns 200.
2. `DBSIZE` is plausible versus the snapshot's `meta`.
3. A known escrow resolves: `GET escrow:<id>` returns the expected status and amount.
4. **Re-run reconciliation.** `EscrowReconciliationService` diffs chain state against the DB
   and repairs drift. A restored Redis may be older than the chain, so this is the fastest way
   to find and fix anything the backup missed.
5. Check `escrow_transaction_inconsistent_total` in `/metrics`. A non-zero value means a
   partially applied `MULTI` is outstanding — see the known gaps in
   [`transaction-boundaries.md`](./transaction-boundaries.md).

## Testing

`backend/src/backup/backup-restore.integration.spec.ts` performs a real dump → drop → restore
round trip against a live PostgreSQL, and asserts the failure modes that matter: checksum
mismatch, truncated gzip, a populated target without `--force`, retention pruning, and that a
failed backup exits non-zero instead of recording an empty file as a success.

```bash
cd backend
docker compose -f ../docker-compose.yml up -d postgres
DATABASE_URL='postgres://trustflow:trustflow@localhost:5432/trustflow_dev' \
  npx jest src/backup
```

It skips itself when `DATABASE_URL` is unset, so `npm test` still works without infrastructure.

## Known gaps

1. **No restore has ever been performed against production data.** The mechanism and an
   automated round trip exist; a human has not yet restored a real backup. This is the single
   most important item here.
2. **No offsite or immutable copies.** Snapshots live wherever the runner or host put them. A
   compromise of that host destroys both the live data and the backups.
3. **No scheduled drill.** Nothing restores on a cadence and reports. The `verify` job in the
   workflow restores a *freshly taken* dump, which proves the scripts work but not that a
   3-week-old backup is still restorable or still has the right retention.
4. **RPO/RTO are unvalidated targets**, stated above as a contract rather than a measurement.
5. **Redis is single-instance with no replica.** There is no failover target, so RTO for a
   total Redis loss is bounded by "copy a snapshot and start a new instance" — measured
   regularly, it is likely well over 30 minutes.
